		EGD is an Entropy Gathering Daemon meant to be used on systems that can
		run GPG but which don't have this convenient source of random bits. It
		is a regular user-space program that sits around, running programs like
		'w' and 'last' and 'vmstat', collecting the randomness (or at least the
		unpredictability) inherent in the output of these system statistics
		programs when used on a reasonably busy system.
