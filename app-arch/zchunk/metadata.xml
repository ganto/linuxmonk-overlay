		zchunk is a compressed file format that splits the file into independent
		chunks. This allows you to only download the differences when
		downloading a new version of the file, and also makes zchunk files
		efficient over rsync. zchunk files are protected with strong checksums
		to verify that the file you downloaded is in fact the file you wanted.
