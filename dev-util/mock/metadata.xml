		A 'simple' chroot build environment manager for building RPMs. Mock is
		used by the Fedora Build system to populate a chroot environment, which
		is then used in building a source-RPM (SRPM). It can be used for
		long-term management of a chroot environment, but generally a chroot
		is populated (using YUM), an SRPM is built in the chroot to generate
		binary RPMs, and the chroot is then discarded.
