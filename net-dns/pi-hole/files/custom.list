# Custom host database
#
# This file can be used to manage custom alias-to-address mappings used and
# served by Pi-hole FTL. It can be updated through the Pi-hole Web interface
# if available.
#
# Alias entries must folow the format of /etc/hosts which is:
#
#   IP_address canonical_hostname [aliases...]
#
# Example:
#
#   192.168.42.42 myhost.mydomain.home
