		httpry is a specialized packet sniffer designed for displaying and
		logging HTTP traffic. It is not intended to perform analysis itself,
		but to capture, parse, and log the traffic for later analysis. It can
		be run in real-time displaying the traffic as it is parsed, or as a
		daemon process that logs to an output file.
