Subject: [PATCH 3/3] Halt a domain before packaging it as a box
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Ensure that we do not try to package a currently running domain (which
will lead to hard to debug and strange issues, and is generally not a
good idea). This may happen when creating boxes with Packer.
